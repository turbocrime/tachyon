//! Tachyon proofs.
//!
//! Tachyon uses **Ragu PCD** (Proof-Carrying Data) for proof generation and
//! aggregation. A single Ragu proof per aggregate covers all actions across
//! multiple bundles.
//!
//! ## Verification
//!
//! The header is not transmitted on the wire. The verifier reconstructs the PCD
//! header from public data according to consensus rules.
//!
//! 1. Recompute `action_acc` from the bundle's actions
//! 2. Recompute `tachygram_acc` from the listed tachygrams
//! 3. Construct the PCD header (`action_acc`, `tachygram_acc`, `anchor`)
//! 4. Call Ragu `verify(Pcd { proof, data: header })`
//!
//! A successful verification with a reconstructed header demonstrates that
//! consensus rules were followed.
//!
//! ## Proving
//!
//! The prover supplies an [`ActionPrivate`] per action, containing private
//! inputs that the circuit checks against the public action and tachygram.
