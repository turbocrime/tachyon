//! Stamps and anchors.
//!
//! A stamp carries the tachygram list, the epoch anchor, and the proof:
//!
//! - **Tachygrams**: Listed individually
//! - **Anchor**: Accumulator state reference (epoch)
//! - **Proof**: The Ragu PCD proof (rerandomized)
//!
//! The PCD proof's public output ([`StampDigest`]) contains
//! `actions_acc`, `tachygram_acc`, and `anchor`. These accumulators are
//! **not serialized** on the stamp — the verifier recomputes them from
//! public data (actions and tachygrams) and passes them as the header
//! to Ragu `verify()`.
