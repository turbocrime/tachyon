//! # tachyon
//!
//! The Tachyon shielded transaction protocol.
//!
//! Tachyon is a scaling solution for Zcash that enables:
//! - **Proof Aggregation**: Multiple Halo proofs aggregated into a single Ragu
//!   proof per block
//! - **Delegated Synchronization**: Wallets can outsource sync to untrusted
//!   services
//! - **Polynomial Accumulators**: Unified tracking of commitments and
//!   nullifiers via tachygrams
//!
//! ## Bundle States
//!
//! [`Bundle<S>`](Bundle) is parameterized by stamp state `S: StampState`:
//!
//! - `Bundle<Unproven>` — actions signed but no proof yet
//! - `Bundle<Stamp>` — aggregate or self-contained, carries a [`Stamp`]
//! - `Bundle<Stripped>` — stamp stripped, covering wtxid not yet assigned
//! - `Bundle<AggregateId>` — stamp stripped, carries the covering
//!   [`AggregateId`]
//! - [`TachyonBundle`] — enum of stamped-or-stripped for mixed contexts
//!
//! ## Block Structure
//!
//! A block may contain stamped and stripped bundles. A stamped bundle's stamp
//! covers its own actions and those of associated stripped bundles.
//!
//! TODO: Block layout is not yet finalized, but provisionally: all adjuncts
//! should immediately follow the aggregate.
//!
//! ## Nomenclature
//!
//! All types in the `tachyon` crate, unless otherwise specified, are
//! Tachyon-specific types.
